The general formula for a geometric sequence is a_n = a_1 * r^(n-1), where a_n is the nth term, a_1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the term number.  We can use this formula to find the common ratio.  The second term is a_2 = a_1 * r^(2-1) = a_1 * r.  The fourth term is a_4 = a_1 * r^(4-1) = a_1 * r^3.  We know that a_4 = 6 and a_2 = 2.  Substituting these values into the formula, we get 6 = a_1 * r^3 and 2 = a_1 * r.  We can solve for r by dividing the first equation by the second equation: 6/2 = r^3.  Therefore, r = 2.  We can now use this value of r to find the first term, a_1.  Substituting r = 2 into the equation 2 = a_1 * r, we get 2 = a_1 * 2.  Therefore, a_1 = 1.
