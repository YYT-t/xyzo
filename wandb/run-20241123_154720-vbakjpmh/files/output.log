decode x:  <bos>Answer the question based on the following example:
Question: Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name? Answer: There are 4 letters in Jamie’s last name, so Bobbie’s name is 4*2 +2 = 10 letters long. Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = 7 letters in Samantha’s last name.
Question: In soccer, players receive yellow cards when they are cautioned and red cards when they are sent off. Coach Tim has a team of 11 players, 5 of them didn't receive cautions, the rest received one yellow card each. How many red cards would the whole team collect, knowing that each red card corresponds to 2 yellow cards?

How many red cards would the whole team collect, knowing that each red card corresponds to 2 yellow cards? Answer: If 5 players received no yellow cards, there are 11 - 5 = 6 players who received a yellow card. With 6 players receiving a yellow card, the coach would collect 6/2 = 3 red cards.

Question: Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name? Answer: There are 4 letters in Jamie’s last name, so Bobbie’s name is 4*2 +2 = 10 letters long. Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = 7 letters in Samantha’s last name.
Question: In soccer, players receive yellow cards when they are cautioned and red cards when they are sent off. Coach Tim has a team of 11 players, 5 of them didn't receive cautions, the rest received one yellow card each. How many red cards would the whole team collect, knowing that each red card corresponds to 2 yellow cards? Answer: If 5 players received no yellow cards, there are 11 - 5 = 6 players who received a yellow card. With 6 players receiving a yellow card, the coach would collect 6/2 = 3 red cards.
The answer is 3.<eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos>

Question: Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name? Answer: There are 4 letters in Jamie’s last name, so Bobbie’s name is 4*2 +2 = 10 letters long. Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = 7 letters in Samantha’s last name.
