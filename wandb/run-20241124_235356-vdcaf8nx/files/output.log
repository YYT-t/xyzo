decode x:  <bos>Answer the question based on the following example:
Question: Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name? Answer: There are 4 letters in Jamie’s last name, so Bobbie’s name is 4*2 +2 = 10 letters long. Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = 7 letters in Samantha’s last name.
Question: Gracie and Joe are choosing numbers on the complex plane. Joe chooses the point $1+2i$. Gracie chooses $-1+i$. How far apart are Gracie and Joe's points?<eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos>

Question: Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name? Answer: There are 4 letters in Jamie’s last name, so Bobbie’s name is 4*2 +2 = 10 letters long. Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = 7 letters in Samantha’s last name.
Question: Gracie and Joe are choosing numbers on the complex plane. Joe chooses the point $1+2i$. Gracie chooses $-1+i$. How far apart are Gracie and Joe's points? Answer: The distance between two points in the complex plane is given by the formula: $$d = |z_1 - z_2|$$
$$d = |(1+2i) - (-1+i)|$$
$$d = |1+2i + 1-i|$$
$$d = |2+i|$$

decode x:  <bos>Answer the question based on the following example:
Question: Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name? Answer: There are 4 letters in Jamie’s last name, so Bobbie’s name is 4*2 +2 = 10 letters long. Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = 7 letters in Samantha’s last name.
Question: Gracie and Joe are choosing numbers on the complex plane. Joe chooses the point $1+2i$. Gracie chooses $-1+i$. How far apart are Gracie and Joe's points?<eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos>

Question: Gracie and Joe are choosing numbers on the complex plane. Joe chooses the point $1+2i$. Gracie chooses $-1+i$. How far apart are Gracie and Joe's points? Answer: The distance between two points in the complex plane is given by the formula: $$d = |z_1 - z_2|$$
$$d = |(1+2i) - (-1+i)|$$
$$d = |1+2i + 1-i|$$
$$d = |2+i|$$

decode x:  <bos>Answer the question based on the following example:
Question: Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name? Answer: There are 4 letters in Jamie’s last name, so Bobbie’s name is 4*2 +2 = 10 letters long. Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = 7 letters in Samantha’s last name.
Question: Gracie and Joe are choosing numbers on the complex plane. Joe chooses the point $1+2i$. Gracie chooses $-1+i$. How far apart are Gracie and Joe's points?<eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos>

Question: Gracie and Joe are choosing numbers on the complex plane. Joe chooses the point $1+2i$. Gracie chooses $-1+i$. How far apart are Gracie and Joe's points? Answer: The distance between two points in the complex plane is given by the formula: $$d = |z_1 - z_2|$$
$$d = |(1+2i) - (-1+i)|$$
$$d = |1+2i + 1-i|$$
$$d = |2+i|$$

$$d = |1+2i + 1-i|$$
$$d = |2+i|$$
The answer is \sqrt{5}.<eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos>
