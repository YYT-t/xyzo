decode x:  <bos>Answer the question based on the following example:
Question: Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name? Answer: There are 4 letters in Jamie’s last name, so Bobbie’s name is 4*2 +2 = 10 letters long. Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = 7 letters in Samantha’s last name.
Question: In soccer, players receive yellow cards when they are cautioned and red cards when they are sent off. Coach Tim has a team of 11 players, 5 of them didn't receive cautions, the rest received one yellow card each. How many red cards would the whole team collect, knowing that each red card corresponds to 2 yellow cards?

Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name? Answer: There are 4 letters in Jamie’s last name, so Bobbie’s name is 4*2 +2 = 10 letters long. Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = 7 letters in Samantha’s last name.
Question: In soccer, players receive yellow cards when they are cautioned and red cards when they are sent off. Coach Tim has a team of 11 players, 5 of them didn't receive cautions, the rest received one yellow card each. How many red cards would the whole team collect, knowing that each red card corresponds to 2 yellow cards? Answer: If 5 players received no yellow cards, there are 11 - 5 = 6 players who received a yellow card. With 6 players receiving a yellow card, the coach would collect 6/2 = 3 red cards.
The answer is 3.<eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos>

decode x:  <bos>Answer the question based on the following example:
Question: Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name? Answer: There are 4 letters in Jamie’s last name, so Bobbie’s name is 4*2 +2 = 10 letters long. Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = 7 letters in Samantha’s last name.

If we know the answer to the above question is 84, what is the value of unknown variable x?

Answer:
**Step 1: Calculate the number of nails used to repair the kitchen.**
30% of 400 = 0.3 * 400 = 120 nails

**Step 2: Calculate the number of nails remaining after repairing the kitchen.**
400 - 120 = 280 nails

**Step 3: Calculate the percentage of nails used to repair the fence.**
x = (120 / 280) * 100 = **43.75%**

Question: Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name? Answer: There are 4 letters in Jamie’s last name, so Bobbie’s name is 4*2 +2 = 10 letters long. Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = 7 letters in Samantha’s last name.

Question: Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name? Answer: There are 4 letters in Jamie’s last name, so Bobbie’s name is 4*2 +2 = 10 letters long. Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = 7 letters in Samantha’s last name.

The number of hours spent in jury deliberation was the equivalent of 6 full days.  They spend 16 hours a day in deliberation. John spends 19 days on jury duty. What is the value of unknown variable x?

Answer: The number of days for jury selection is x.  The number of days for the trial is 4x.  The number of hours spent in deliberation is 16 * x.  The number of hours spent in deliberation is also 6 * 16 = 96.  Setting these two values equal to each other, we get 16 * x = 96.  Solving for x, we get x = 6.

decode x:  <bos>Answer the question based on the following example:
Question: Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name? Answer: There are 4 letters in Jamie’s last name, so Bobbie’s name is 4*2 +2 = 10 letters long. Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = 7 letters in Samantha’s last name.

decode x:  <bos>Answer the question based on the following example:
Question: Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name? Answer: There are 4 letters in Jamie’s last name, so Bobbie’s name is 4*2 +2 = 10 letters long. Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = 7 letters in Samantha’s last name.

Question: Susie has 572 beans in the jar. One-fourth of them are red and one-third of the remaining beans are white. Then half of the remaining are green beans. How many green beans are there? Answer: There are 3 types of beans in the jar. Let x be the number of green beans. Then, the number of red beans is (1/4)x and the number of white beans is (1/3)(x- (1/4)x). The sum of these is equal to the number of beans in the jar, so: x + (1/4)x + (1/3)(x- (1/4)x) = 572.

decode x:  <bos>Answer the question based on the following example:
Question: Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name? Answer: There are 4 letters in Jamie’s last name, so Bobbie’s name is 4*2 +2 = 10 letters long. Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = 7 letters in Samantha’s last name.

Question: Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name? Answer: There are 4 letters in Jamie’s last name, so Bobbie’s name is 4*2 +2 = 10 letters long. Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = 7 letters in Samantha’s last name.

Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = 7 letters in Samantha’s last name.

Question: Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name? Answer: There are 4 letters in Jamie’s last name, so Bobbie’s name is 4*2 +2 = 10 letters long. Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = 7 letters in Samantha’s last name.
Question: If there are 6 people going on an airplane trip, and each person has 5 bags of luggage weighing the maximum weight of 50 pounds, with the airplane having a maximum luggage weight capacity of 6000 pounds, how many more bags at the maximum weight can the plane hold?<eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos>

decode x:  <bos>Answer the question based on the following example:
Question: Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name? Answer: There are 4 letters in Jamie’s last name, so Bobbie’s name is 4*2 +2 = 10 letters long. Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = 7 letters in Samantha’s last name.
Question: A sphere is inscribed in a cube. Given that one edge of the cube is X inches, how many cubic inches are in the volume of the inscribed sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\pi$. The answer is 36. What is the value of unknown variable X?

decode x:  <bos>Answer the question based on the following example:
Question: Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name? Answer: There are 4 letters in Jamie’s last name, so Bobbie’s name is 4*2 +2 = 10 letters long. Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = 7 letters in Samantha’s last name.
Question: The school is planning to add 5 rows of seats to the auditorium. Each row consists of 8 seats, and the cost of each seat is $30. A parent, who happens to be a seat manufacturer, is offering a 10% discount on every group of 10 seats purchased. What will be the total payment that the school needs to make for the new seats?<eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos>

A parent, who happens to be a seat manufacturer, is offering a 10% discount on every group of 10 seats purchased. What will be the total payment that the school needs to make for the new seats? Answer: There are 8 seats in each row, and 5 rows in total. The cost of each seat is $30. So, the total cost of the seats is 8 * 30 = $240. The school needs to purchase 10 seats at a time to get the 10% discount, so the total cost of the new seats is 240/10 * 8 = $216.

decode x:  <bos>Answer the question based on the following example:
Question: Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name? Answer: There are 4 letters in Jamie’s last name, so Bobbie’s name is 4*2 +2 = 10 letters long. Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = 7 letters in Samantha’s last name.
Question: Suppose $\sqrt{1 + \sqrt{2y-3}} = \sqrt{6}$; find $y$.<eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos>

Question: Suppose $\sqrt{1 + \sqrt{2y-3}} = \sqrt{6}$; find $y$.

Answer:
$$\sqrt{1 + \sqrt{2y-3}} = \sqrt{6}$$

$$1 + \sqrt{2y-3} = 6$$

$$ \sqrt{2y-3} = 5$$

$$ 2y-3 = 25$$

$$ 2y = 28$$

$$ y = 14$$

decode x:  <bos>Answer the question based on the following example:
Question: Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name? Answer: There are 4 letters in Jamie’s last name, so Bobbie’s name is 4*2 +2 = 10 letters long. Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = 7 letters in Samantha’s last name.
Question: If the mother wants to make her own bubble mix using a recipe that requires 3 tablespoons of soap for every 1 cup of water, and she wants to store the mix in a container that can hold 40 ounces of liquid (with 8 ounces in a cup), how many tablespoons of soap should she add to the container, considering that the soap itself doesn't count towards the container's capacity?

Question: Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name? Answer: There are 4 letters in Jamie’s last name, so Bobbie’s name is 4*2 +2 = 10 letters long. Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = 7 letters in Samantha’s last name.

decode x:  <bos>Answer the question based on the following example:
Question: Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name? Answer: There are 4 letters in Jamie’s last name, so Bobbie’s name is 4*2 +2 = 10 letters long. Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = 7 letters in Samantha’s last name.

decode x:  <bos>Answer the question based on the following example:
Question: Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name? Answer: There are 4 letters in Jamie’s last name, so Bobbie’s name is 4*2 +2 = 10 letters long. Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = 7 letters in Samantha’s last name.

If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name? Answer: There are 4 letters in Jamie’s last name, so Bobbie’s name is 4*2 +2 = 10 letters long. Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = 7 letters in Samantha’s last name.\nQuestion: After donating 5 pieces of clothing to one orphanage home and triple that amount to another orphanage home, and also deciding to throw away 15 old clothes, how many pieces of clothing does Amara have left if she initially had 100?\n\nAnswer: The number of pieces of clothing Amara has left is 100 - (5 + 5*3 + 15) = 100 - 5 - 15 - 15 = **70** pieces of clothing.']

What is the area of the region within the fence, in square feet?\n\n[asy]draw((0,0)--(16,0)--(16,12)--(28,12)--(28,0)--(60,0)--(60,48)--(0,48)--cycle);\nlabel("15\'",(30,48),N);\nlabel("12\'",(60,24),E);\nlabel("3\'",(16,6),W);\nlabel("3\'",(22,12),N);\n[/asy]\n\nAnswer: The area of the region within the fence is 156 square feet.\n[/answer]\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe area of the rectangle is 15 feet * 12 feet = 180 square feet.\n\nThe area of the square is 3 feet * 3 feet = 9 square feet.\n\nThe area of the region within the fence is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the square: 180 square feet - 9 square feet = 156 square feet.']

Question: Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name? Answer: There are 4 letters in Jamie’s last name, so Bobbie’s name is 4*2 +2 = 10 letters long. Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = 7 letters in Samantha’s last name.
Question: If there are 30 major league baseball stadiums and Zach wants to take his son to see at least one game at each stadium, with an average cost of $900 per stadium, and he can save $1,500 per year for his baseball stadium trips, how many years will it take Zach to achieve his goal?<eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos>

Answer: The total cost of all the stadium visits is 30 * $900 = $27,000. The amount he can save per year is $1,500. So, it will take him 27,000 / 1,500 = 18 years to save for all 30 stadium visits.

Question: Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name? Answer: There are 4 letters in Jamie’s last name, so Bobbie’s name is 4*2 +2 = 10 letters long. Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = 7 letters in Samantha’s last name.
Question: What is the difference in area between the largest room, which is 45 feet wide and 30 feet long, and the smallest room, which is 15 feet wide and 8 feet long, in Mrs. McAvoy's house?
