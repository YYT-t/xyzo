decode x:  <bos>Answer the question based on the following example:
Question: Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name? Answer: There are 4 letters in Jamie’s last name, so Bobbie’s name is 4*2 +2 = 10 letters long. Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = 7 letters in Samantha’s last name.
Question: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?

decode x:  <bos>Answer the question based on the following example:
Question: Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name? Answer: There are 4 letters in Jamie’s last name, so Bobbie’s name is 4*2 +2 = 10 letters long. Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = 7 letters in Samantha’s last name.
Question: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?

decode x:  <bos>Answer the question based on the following example:
Question: Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name? Answer: There are 4 letters in Jamie’s last name, so Bobbie’s name is 4*2 +2 = 10 letters long. Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = 7 letters in Samantha’s last name.
Question: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
