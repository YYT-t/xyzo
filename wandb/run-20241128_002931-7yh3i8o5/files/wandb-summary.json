She shared them between Susan, Andrew and Sam in the ratio 1:1:3 respectively. If Sam gave Andrew two-thirds of his own share, how many stickers does Andrew now have? Answer: There are 1500 stickers in total. Let x be the number of stickers Andrew has. Then, the number of stickers Susan has is x and the number of stickers Sam has is 3x. Sam gave Andrew two-thirds of his own share, so he gave Andrew (3x/3) = x stickers. Therefore, Andrew now has x + x = 2x stickers.","Answer the question based on the following example:\nQuestion: Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name.

And Milo's best friend, Cory, can drive his wheelchair at twice the speed that Milo can roll downhill on his skateboard.  If Cory always drives his wheelchair at 12 miles per hour, how many miles can Milo run in two hours? Answer: The speed of Milo running is half the speed of his skateboarding.  The speed of Cory driving is twice the speed of Milo skateboarding.  So the speed of Milo running is 12 / 2 = 6 miles per hour.  Milo can run 6 miles in two hours.","Answer the question based on the following example:\nQuestion: Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name.
